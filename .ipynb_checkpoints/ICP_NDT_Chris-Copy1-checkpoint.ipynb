    "The project objective is to achieve the localization for a car driving within a simulated environment, covering a minimum distance of 170m from its starting position, while keeping the distance pose error within 1.2m. To accomplish this, we will make use of pointclouds extracted from a simulated car equipped with a lidar, which provides regular lidar scans. Additionally, there is an existing point cloud map \"map.pcd\" available, extracted from the CARLA simulator. We can achieve localization for the car by using point registration algorithms ICP and NDT matching between the map and the scans. We will then evaluate the disatnce pose error between the pose we get from localization algorithm and from the ground truth provided along with the dataset"

    "The ICP algorithm, or Iterative Closest Point algortihm, is an algorithm which is used to register two or more point clouds by refining a transformation matrix that aligns the source point cloud with the target point cloud. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the closest points between the two clouds, and then estimates a transformation matrix that aligns the source points with the target points. This process is repeated until the algorithm converges, meaning that the change in the transformation matrix between two iterations falls below a certain threshold.\n",

    "\n",
    "- voxelize = 0.2 -> sets the size of the voxels that will be used to downsample the point clouds. A smaller voxel size will result in a higher level of detail, but will also increase the computation time.\n",
    "- icp_params.relative_fitness = 1e-6 and icp_params.relative_rmse = 1e-6 -> these two parameters set the convergence criteria for the elgorithm. The relative fitness is responsible for the maximum allowed change in fitness and the relative rsme is responsible for the maximum allowed change in RSME between two consecutive iterations.\n",
    "- max_correspondence_distance = 1.6 -> sets the maximum distance between corresponding points in source and target cloud\n",
